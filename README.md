1) Generating Message in C program :- 
  This is basic profram using c language for generating message. When someone order pizza then by pizza shop this message send to the customer.

  In this program we use basic functions of C language: Such as:

  printf(): To perform Output Operation.

  scanf() : Tp perform input Operation. (Take input from user)

  usleep(): To suspends the current process for the number of microseconds passed to it.

  and for clean code we use new line character (\n).
  
2) Calculate area of circle :- 
 
This is a basic program for calculating area of Circle.

Formula for calculating Area of circle is:-

Area = PI * Radius * Radius.

In this program we decalre pi as a constant(the value which can not be change after initialize once) because pi value is fixed(3.141).
and the constant value is declare using "const" keyword.
